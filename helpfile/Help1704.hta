                                    <p>
                                        The return shall be filed within 15 days after the close of the

with the Revenue Collection Officer or Duly Authorized City or
Municipal Treasurer of the municipality or city under the jurisdiction of
the Revenue District Office where the taxpayer’s principal place of
business is located and registered.

with the AAB located at the BIR National Office except if said taxpayer
is under the jurisdiction of a Large Taxpayer District Office, (LTDO), in
which case the return shall be filed with the LTDO having jurisdiction
over the taxpayer.
                                    </p>

in full to the AAB where the return is filed. In places where there are no
AABs, payment shall be made directly to the Revenue Collection
Officer or duly Authorized City or Municipal Treasurer who shall issue
Revenue Official Receipt (BIR Form No. 2524) therefor.

                                        Where the return is filed with an AAB, the lower portion
must be duly machine validated and stamped received to serve as
receipt of payment. The machine validation shall reflect the amount
paid, the date of payment and the transaction code and the stamp
mark shall show the name of the AAB, branch code, teller’s code and
teller’s initial. The AAB shall also issue an Official Receipt as proof of
payment.
