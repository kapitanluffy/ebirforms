                                    <dt>When and Where to File</dt>

                                    <p>In places where there are no AABs, the return shall be filed directly with the Revenue Collection Officer or duly Authorized City or Municipal Treasurer within the Revenue District Office where the taxpayer is required to register/which has jurisdiction over the location of the principal office of the “CORPORATION” filing the return.</p>

                                    <p>Where the return is filed with an AAB, taxpayer must accomplish and submit BIR-prescribed deposit slip, which the bank teller shall machine validate as evidence that payment was received by the AAB. The AAB receiving the tax return shall stamp mark the word “Received” on the return and also machine validate the return as proof of filing the return and payment of the tax by the taxpayer, respectively.

Bank debit memo number and date should be indicated in the return for taxpayers paying under the bank debit system.</p>

                                    <p><u><i>Optional Standard Deduction (OSD)</i></u> – A maximum of 40% of the gross income shall be allowed as deduction in lieu of the itemized deduction. However, a corporation who availed and claimed this deduction is still required to submit its financial statements when it files its annual tax return and to keep such records pertaining to its gross income. </p>
                                    <p><u><i>Itemized Deduction</i></u> – There shall be allowed as deduction from gross income all the ordinary and necessary trade and business expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on or which are directly attributable to the development, management, operation and/or conduct of the trade and business. Itemized deduction includes also interest, taxes, losses, bad debts, depreciation, depletion, charitable and other contributions, research and development and pension trust.       </p>

However, to simplify and for ease of administration July 1, 2008 shall be considered as the start of the period when the 40% OSD may be allowed.</p>

                                    <dt>Minimum Corporate Income Tax (MCIT)</dt>

The MCIT shall be imposed whenever the corporation has zero or negative taxable income or whenever the amount of minimum corporate income tax is greater than the normal income tax due from such corporation. Any excess of the MCIT over the normal income tax shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax for the three (3) immediate succeeding taxable years.  </p>
                                    <p>The computation and the payment of MCIT shall apply each time a corporate income tax return is filed, whether quarterly or annual basis. </p>
