                                        The term “Capital Asset” shall mean property held by the
taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business),
but does not include stock in trade of the taxpayer or other
property of a kind which would properly be included in the
inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable
year, or property held primarily for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of trade or business, or property used in the
trade or business of a character which is subject to the
allowance for depreciation, or real property used in trade or
business.

                                        The return shall be filed within thirty (30) days after
each sale, barter, exchange or other disposition of shares of stock
not traded through the local stock exchange.

                                        In case of installment sale where the taxpayer is legally
allowed to pay the tax by installment under certain conditions
and requirements, the return shall be filed within thirty (30)
days following the receipt of the first down payment and within
thirty (30) days following each subsequent installment payment.
                                    </p>

                                        The return shall be filed by the seller with any
Authorized Agent Bank (AAB) under the jurisdiction of the
Revenue District Office (RDO) where the seller/transferor is
required to register. In places where there are no Authorized
Agent Banks (AABs), the return shall be filed with the Revenue
Collection Officer or Duly Authorized City or Municipal
Treasurer of the Revenue District Office where the
seller/transferor is required to register.

paid to the Authorized Agent Bank (AAB) where the return is
filed. In places where there are no AABs, payments shall be
made directly to the Revenue Collection Officer or duly
Authorized City or Municipal Treasurer who shall issue

                                        Where the return is filed with an AAB, the lower portion
of the return must be properly machine-validated and stamped
by the Authorized Agent Bank to serve as the receipt of
payment. The machine validation shall reflect the date of
payment, amount paid and transaction code, and the stamp mark
shall show the name of the bank, branch code, teller’s name and
teller’s initial. The AAB shall also issue an official receipt or
bank debit advice or credit document, whichever is applicable,
as additional proof of payment.
