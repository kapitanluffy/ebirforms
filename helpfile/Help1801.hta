                                        This return shall be filed within six (6) months from the decedent's death. In
meritorious cases, the Commissioner shall have authority to grant a reasonable extension not
exceeding thirty (30) days for filing the return.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A certified copy of the schedule of partition and the order of the court approving the
same shall be furnished the Commissioner within thirty (30) days after the promulgation of
such order.

                                        The return shall be filed with any Authorized Agent Bank (AAB) of the Revenue
District Office having jurisdiction over the place of domicile of the decedent at the time of his
death. In places where there are no AABs, the return shall be filed with the Revenue
Collection Officer or duly Authorized City/Municipal Treasurer of the Revenue District Office
having jurisdiction over the place of domicile of the decedent at the time of his death. If the
decedent has no legal residence in the Philippines, the return shall be filed with the Office of
the Commissioner (Revenue District Office No. 39, South Quezon City).
                                    </p>

                                        Upon filing this return, the estate tax due shall be paid to the Authorized Agent Bank
(AAB) where the return is filed. In places where there are no AABs, payment shall be made
directly to the Revenue Collection Officer or duly Authorized City or Municipal Treasurer
who shall issue Revenue Official Receipt (BIR Form No. 2524) therefor.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Where the return is filed with an AAB, the lower portion of the return must be properly
machine-validated and stamped by the Authorized Agent Bank to serve as the receipt of
payment. The machine validation shall reflect the date of payment, amount paid and
transaction code, and the stamp mark shall show the name of the bank, branch code, teller’s
name and teller’s initial. The AAB shall also issue an official receipt or bank debit advice or
credit document, whichever is applicable, as additional proof of payment.
                                    </p>

                                        When the Commissioner finds that the payment on the due date of the estate tax or of
any part thereof would impose undue hardship upon the estate or any of the heirs, he may
extend the time for payment of such tax or any part thereof not to exceed five (5) years, in case
the estate is settled through the courts, or two (2) years in case the estate is settled
extrajudicially. In such case, the amount in respect of which the extension is granted shall be
paid on or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, and the running of
the Statute of Limitations for assessment as provided in Section 203 of the National Internal
Revenue Code shall be suspended for the period of any such extension.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Where the taxes are assessed by reason of negligence, intentional disregard of rules and
regulations, or fraud on the part of the taxpayer, no extension will be granted by the
Commissioner.

                                    <p>
                                        If an extension is granted, the Commissioner may require the executor, or administrator,
or beneficiary, as the case may be, to furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the
amount of the tax and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned
upon the payment of the said tax in accordance with the terms of the extension.
